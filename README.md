# GaussianProp
Calculates beam width in a multi lens system for multiple frequencies over the system length

For example in a two lens system, in a confocal configuration, with a columnated input beam with radius 3 mm:
1. Lens, Focal Length 5 cm, at a position of 5 cm
1. Lens, Focal Length 10 cm, at a position of 20 cm (confocal)

The frequency dependent waist of the beam as it propagates through the system is shown. Lens location is shown by the dotted lines, the focal length of each lens is indicated by the faded arrows.
